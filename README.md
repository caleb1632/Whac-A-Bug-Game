The Game Scenario

The country of Renovian is overrun with bugs.  The bugs are evil creatures that live below the surface in bug-holes and when triggered attack human beings.  The bugs come in various forms: hornets, killerants, and spiders and move through the land in different ways, attacking all humans in their path.

There is a group of humans that are charged with ridding the country of these nefarious creatures.   The key is to find the bug-holes that release the bugs and kill the bugs as they surface.

The humans have different strengths.  Warriors are strong hand-to-hand fighters whereas Explorers are more skilled with range weapons.  Players move around the board trying to stay alive and kill as many bugs as possible.
